    "content": "<p>Hello Friends,</p>\n<p><em><strong>We were just talking this past week that last year was the perfect time in this season in our lives to relocate to America and to continue the ministry based out of here.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>We are personally doing wonderful.</strong></em> Oh of course we have normal issues that most people have in daily life. But we are always reminded of how we are absolutely so so blessed in what we get to do, not only in ministry but with our family and in so many other ways. God has blessed us so amazingly and continues to do so.</p>\n<p>One of our absolutely favorite songs for the last few years has been a song written and sung by Jenn Johnson called <strong>THE GOODNESS OF GOD.  Often we get chiles when we hear it or sing it in church.</strong> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/n0FBb6hnwTo?si=1xJKkG1bmON-pBdX\">Click Here to View</a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a year and a half since we relocated back to America after living over 25 years in Eastern Europe. And we totally love living here seeing our families, kids and grandkids so much more.</p>\n<p>This summer we will also be going to my (Jim) family reunion in Colorado. <em><strong>I am one of eight children and all of us eight &#8220;kids&#8221; plus my 94 year old Mom and three of our four children plus grandkids will all be there.</strong> </em>We somehow manage to all get together every two years. It&#8217;s wonderful to reconnect with my brothers and sisters coming from Alaska, South Dakota, Oregon, California and of course Colorado.</p>\n<p>Also this summer I (Jim) will once again be in Hungary and Albania. These times when I am back in this part of the world sometimes feels like going back &#8220;home&#8221;. Seeing pastors and other key Christian leaders we have worked with for over 20 years and continuing to work with them to help them reach their countries with the Gospel.</p>\n<p><strong>Making an impact on Poland</strong></p>\n<h3>We have probably helped to start more churches in Poland than any other country in Eastern Europe.</h3>\n<p>We have done this through working with so many different key leaders and ministries in this large country of over 40 million people.</p>\n<p><strong>These photos here are of a church we helped to start last year and are of the Pastor and his wife and children&#8217;s church and the service. Notice the words of the worship song in Polish.  </strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>So many key leaders with names like Zibi and Magda in Krakow, Poland. Whose church is now 15 years old and is full of university students and young families.</strong></em></p>\n<p>I think of leaders like Mariusz, who I met in about 2005 and through his ministry we helped start churches throughout all of southern Poland in cities and towns with few if any evangelical churches.</p>\n<p>I could name others like Arek and Angelica with whom we have helped his ministry start over 10 churches in the last five years.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s through these leaders and Pastors that we can help them reach their country, Poland, with the Gospel.</p>\n<p>Thank you for helping us do this. We continue to invest $4000 as seed funds in each of these new churches. They are making an impact on Poland.</p>\n<p>We want to try to help start at least SEVEN churches like this each year. So many lives are changed through these local churches. We get to be a small part of each of them.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank You for all you do for us,</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Brenda and Jim</strong></p>\n",

Even later this week we get to go on vacation with one of our sons and family to Gulf Shores, Alabama.</p>\n<p>They, Ryan and Katie and their two boys will come down from Nashville and meet us there for four days on the beach.

This church in Sofia was sponsored by some freinds in Reno, Nevada. So many from around America have given this much to help start these churches. We and they are so greatful.</p>\n<p><em><strong>This is just one church of hundreds that have been started in the last 24 years in Eastern Europe through Pastors like Philip and Rositca.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Thank You for all you do for us,</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 24pt;\">Brenda and Jim</span></strong></p>\n",

In May I was once again in Bulgaria meeting with and working with three different ministries we work with there.</p>\n<p>One of them was Filip and Rosy Rashev, whom we have been working with since 2019. We helped Filip and Rosy start a church and it was such a privilege to be with him to see first hand how their church is growing some 5 years later.</p>\n<p><strong>Seeing the young people on the worship team, hearing the worship, and see this thriving church make such an impact on so many really humbled me</strong>.</p>\n<p>We could tell this same story in every country we work in Eastern Europe.</p>\n<p>Filip and Rosy told me that we were the very first people to help him when they started their church and that us believing in them and their vision was a key reason they are thriving today.</p>\n<p>Thank you for helping us do what we do. Please know it is NEVER TAKEN for granted.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 24pt;\">Jim and Brenda</span></p>\n",

Sometimes we wonder if people realize how blessed this country is in so many ways.</strong></p>\n<p>We are sure you have experienced many changes in your life too. It&#8217;s an adjustment that we all face and it&#8217;s part of &#8220;life.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Brenda has a bit more of a challenge as she doesn&#8217;t get to go back to Eastern Europe as much as I, Jim do. She misses her friends and just the life we have known there for so many years.</p>\n<p>But like we said earlier, we LOVE living in America after so many years away!</p>\n<p>There are so many great changes too. We do love the change of seeing our kids and grand-kids so much more. Especially a couple<a href=\"http://cmiworld.bezalelstudio.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Brenda-and-Miles.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1761 alignleft\" src=\"http://cmiworld.bezalelstudio.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Brenda-and-Miles.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"185\" height=\"188\" /></a> of weeks ago going to Orlando to celebrate our youngest grandson&#8217;s &#8220;one year birthday&#8221; (see photo) with our oldest son, Nathan and his family. And Brenda got to go to Nashville to be with our other son, Ryan and his family and play with our two grandsons there.</p>\n<p>Our oldest daughter Alexandra, has loved being around family too. She was so happy to have many of her family singing to her on her Birthday on April 13. Our youngest daughter, Audrianna and her husband live about 50 minutes from us so we get to spend more time with them too!</p>\n<p>So those changes are so nice and we cherish everyone of those moments.</p>\n<p><strong>In the coming weeks I, Jim will once again be in Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary and Albania. We keep going forward with the ministry with so many world changers that we work alongside there.</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Thank you for helping us continue to reach that part of the world with the Gospel.</strong></em></p>\n<h3>Impacting Poland</h3>\n<p><strong>We never tire of working with key pastors in all the countries of Eastern Europe. It continues to amaze us how God puts us together with so many key Pastors that are working to start more churches in cities and towns that still have few if any churches in them.</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>This month once again a Pastor contacted me from Poland. He was referred to us by my good Polish Pastor friend Arek, with whom we have helped start several churches in southern Poland.</strong> </em>All of these new churches are started through relationships that God has given us here in Eastern Europe.</p>\n<p>He, like so many we work with, is already pastoring a church in southern Poland, but wants to start another church in a city near him. This city has a group of people from his church that travel 25 miles to his church, but want a church in their own city.</p>\n<p>S<strong>o we are partnering with him, with $4,000 in seed money to help the new pastor get this church off the ground.</strong></p>\n<p>This is typical of how we connect with Pastors and leaders in Eastern Europe. They have applications and several forms to fill out to apply for the funds.</p>\n<p>Not only in Poland will we see another church started but also in Macedonia and other countries. Thank you for helping us do this.</p>\n<p><strong>In May I will be in Poland again, one of my favorite countries we work in.

Since that time we have worked with pastors in Poland and Bulgaria and here in Hungary to coordinate AID to some of the the millions of refugees that have fled Ukraine. We are doing just a small part.</p>\n<p>We feel like it&#8217;s so important for us to be here at this time.<a href=\"http://cmiworld.bezalelstudio.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Phyllis.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1705 alignright\" src=\"http://cmiworld.bezalelstudio.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Phyllis.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"373\" /></a></p>\n<p>In the midst of this, we hope to still see at least 10 churches started this year.</p>\n<p>Special Family Updates;   Brenda&#8217;s Mom is Now in Heaven</p>\n<p>From Brenda.   &#8220;On Thursday April 14 My Sweet, Beautiful Mama went to be with Jesus!

But we are praising God that she is with Him&#8221;!</p>\n<p>I flew to Florida (Brenda) on Wednesday April 13 and my Mom passed the next morning.</p>\n<p>I was so thankful I was there with my family and we shared so many special memories of her. It was a really precious time.</p>\n<p>God is so good! Just a few days before my Mom went to be with Jesus, He sent us our new grand-son, Miles Atlas, who was born to Nathan and Lori in Orlando on April 7.</p>\n<p>My time with our newest grand-baby was such a gift from God. It was so wonderful to see his little toes and tiny fingers.</p>\n<p>Seeing our son Nathan and Lori and our grand-daughter Lenora, was so so sweet. We now have four grand-kids. It is so nice being a grandmother.<a href=\"http://cmiworld.bezalelstudio.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Brenda-and-Miles.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-1704 alignright\" src=\"http://cmiworld.bezalelstudio.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Brenda-and-Miles.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"244\" height=\"325\" /></a></p>\n<p>So in the midst of losing my mother it was such a gift to see this new little life coming into our family.</p>\n<p>We are more excited than ever about what God has called us to do in this part of the world. Thank you for helping us do it.</p>\n<p>In Awe of His Faithfulness,</p>\n<p><strong>Jim and Brenda </strong></p>\n",

Some people are nervous that the war will spread.</p>\n<p>There is a lot of Aid that has arrived here in all the countries around Ukraine to help the refugees. So many from America, and Hungary and around the world have given so much to help.</p>\n<p>With us living here we are able to do &#8220;targeting aid&#8221;.

Most have gone to Poland but hundreds of thousands of others have gone to Slovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria. But the second most have come here to Hungary with over 200,000.</p>\n<p>As soon as they cross the border from Ukraine, Hungary provides free Humanitarian trains so they can come to Budapest.. The border towns are not equipped to handle the refugees.</p>\n<p>Budapest is well equipped to help them and many of the refugees go on from Budapest to different places throughout Europe to stay with friends or family until they can return home to Ukraine. But many stay in Hungary.</p>\n<p>This week I was at one of the train stations where the refugees arrive. I was there with one of my Hungarian Pastor friends to provide Aid.. <strong>Just seeing the faces of the mothers with their children with just a small suitcase with all their belongings, it breaks your heart.</strong></p>\n<p>We have been able to help coordinate the funding and distribution of Aid in Hungary, Poland and Bulgaria through some of the Pastor Friends we have in those countries. So many have given Aid from America to help these people. Thank you!</p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t know what the future holds with the war or how long it will last. But one thing we know for sure is so many peoples lives are changed forever and are devastated.</p>\n<p>We are glad we are here, to help some of them. What we are doing is small compared to so many other Aid Organizations. But to the people receiving it. it means so much.</p>\n<p><strong>Trusting God in Challenging Times,</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jim and Brenda</strong></p>\n",

Ukraine borders Hungary just to the east. Hungary has opened its borders to all Ukrainian refugees but most are fleeing to Poland.</p>\n<p>But still as of today over 100,000 have come to Hungary fleeing the war.  We don&#8217;t know how many are flooding into Romania and other countries&#8230;</p>\n<p>Even today I was in contact with one of the churches we helped to start in Eastern Hungary and Krakow, Poland. They are helping so many of those that are fleeing the war in Ukraine and coming to Hungary and Poland.</p>\n<p>I have been to Ukraine throughout the years and we have helped to start churches in Ukraine and hearing so many of the Christians stories of what they are suffering is hard to imagine.</p>\n<p>So many friends in America have been in contact with us in the last few days letting us know they are praying for us and concerned for us. This is so so helpful and encouraging to us.</p>\n<p>Of course in Hungary this is the non-stop news and what happens with this war impacts all of the former Communist countries that used to be under the Soviet Union.</p>\n<p>So as you can imagine how you feel in America about this, imagine how you would feel living in the countries all around this area.</p>\n<p>In the midst of all this we go forward with what we feel God is leading us to do. In the coming weeks I will be in Slovenia, and Albania again. In this midst of all this we still see so much opportunity to reach people in this part of the world.</p>\n<p>We are doing all we can while we can. Thank you for helping us do this.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Family News&#8230;.</strong></p>\n<p>On February 18 our youngest daughter Audrianna, got married and we are so thankful we were able to come back to the USA for<a href=\"http://cmiworld.bezalelstudio.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/All-Photos-1-of-1-57.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-1677 alignright\" src=\"http://cmiworld.bezalelstudio.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/All-Photos-1-of-1-57-242x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"275\" height=\"341\" /></a> the wedding. It was so nice and special and very relaxing. Both our boys, Nathan and Ryan and their families got to come to the wedding too and it was amazingly nice having all of us together.</p>\n<p>Audrianna is now Mrs. Barry O&#8217;Sullivan and we like him very much and fits in our family so well. They came to Budapest for Christmas so we got to know him quite well. We are so happy he is a strong Christian. Both of his parents were born in Ireland and he took vacations to Ireland and Europe often growing up.</p>\n<p>This is so nice as Audrianna was just eight months old when she moved to Budapest and most of her life has been on the mission field with us.</p>\n<p>They will live in West Palm Beach, Florida. But plan to visit us as often as they can.</p>\n<p>Loving Serving Our Lord,</p>\n<p>Jim and Brenda</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<div class=\"shell\" lang=\"en-US\"></div>\n</div>\n",

Here they call highways &#8220;Autópálya&#8221; (Hungarian) or use the German word, &#8220;AUTOBAHN.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s pretty easy, even going to Slovenia or Serbia for the day and may other countries and coming back in the same day. There are speed limits on the highways. It&#8217;s usually 130 kilometers per hour. Which is in the low 80&#8217;s in mph.</p>\n<p>The highways are very safe and we love to take them everywhere. Sometimes we take the trains or even fly as it&#8217;s pretty convenient. Budapest has direct flights to to all the major cities in the countries of Eastern Europe.</p>\n<p>Fortunately we both love to travel so rarely do we get tired of going to so many places. The nice thing about living in Budapest in the center of Eastern Europe is that when we do travel we usually are not gone for more than one or two nights.

Sometimes through the online streaming of services or through Food Banks and a thousand other ways. So many amazing stories. So many lives touched.</p>\n<p><strong>We here in Hungary are also impacted by this but at the same time we try to continue to do what we feel God has called us to over here as missionaries.</strong></p>\n<p>Hungary also has social distancing, but most businesses are open or are opening and most people, including us wear masks as we go out in public.</p>\n<p>The borders to most of the countries are opening.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the same throughout all of Eastern Europe where we are in contact with so many of our friends from Poland to the north to Bulgaria and Albania to the very south.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s amazing to see the response of so many churches, adapting so quickly to online services.</p>\n<p>We also attend church online over here..

Thank you for helping us do this.</p>\n<p>IN the Midst of all this there is an &#8220;air of expectancy&#8221; in the people.

Neither Brenda nor I are big news watchers. In fact rarely have we had the news on in the last 10 years here in our house in Budapest.</p>\n<p><strong>Brenda was supposed to go to Nashville last week (see video below for a two minute update from Budapest) to see our new grandson, Jamie Robert Puhr, who was born to our son Ryan and his wife Katie. But because of all the airline/travel issues she canceled her plans.</strong></p>\n<p>Here in Hungary, like America, things are changing daily. Even today they closed the schools.</p>\n<p>They also <strong>closed the borders to other </strong>countries around us today.. Hungarian citizens can come and go but other nationalities cannot. Hungary borders<strong> SEVEN </strong>countries,. Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Romania, Ukraine and Slovakia.</p>\n<p>There are few cases of the virus in Hungary as of today. I think we saw today that there were 29 cases. One person has died who had the virus.</p>\n<p><strong>In the midst of this we have total PEACE</strong>. The authorities also closed down meetings of over 100 people So like many in America yesterday, we watched our church service here in Hungary online. It was great that were able to do this but we did miss being with everyone.</p>\n<p><strong>So we expect this to be over with soon, and people&#8217;s lives will get back to &#8220;normal&#8221;.</strong></p>\n<p>In the meantime in the coming weeks people here in Hungary, like in America, are concerned about their jobs, groceries, etc, and all that was once normal in their lives.</p>\n<p>There is much to get &#8220;nervous&#8221; about. But we go forward trusting in OUR GOD.</p>\n<p><strong>So thank you for thinking of us, praying for us, supporting us, in this time of uncertainty.</strong></p>\n<p>You may want to watch the TWO minute video update from Brenda that was made on March 13.  Lots of things have changed since them, but it will give you insight into things over here.</p>\n<p>In Awe of His Faithfulness</p>\n<p><strong>Jim and Brenda</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Brenda is at Szabadság Tér, which is Liberty Square in English, here in Budapest.

(See photo).</p>\n<p>Now so many years later we still feel like this is where we are supposed to be, reaching Eastern Europe.</p>\n<p><strong>Sometimes I wish you could be there with us as we travel from country to country in Eastern Europe visiting church after church and seeing the gratefulness of these pastors and many new Christians that are now Christians because of these new churches that we help to start.</strong></p>\n<p>I think of the young Moms that I met on one of my recent trips to Albania. When they heard from the leader, we work with there to help start churches, that we were the ones that gave the funds to help start the church that they were a part of they told me over and over (in Albanian) what their church has meant to them.</p>\n<p>This same story could be told over and over again from people all over Eastern Europe.

The Gypsy Churches are so challenging, yet it is so fulfilling to see these people years later worshiping, totally transformed.</p>\n<p><strong>So there are just FOUR months remaining in the year so we will see so much happening and we will be traveling so much.</strong> But we love it. We are always amazed that by living in Budapest we can be in so many countries in just a few hours. Rarely do we spend more than one night away from home when we minister over here. But often we are able to visit other countries and come home the SAME DAY. It&#8217;s so nice to be able to do so much in such a short time.</p>\n<p>So even though we are starting our 23rd year here in Budapest, we are more excited than ever about what God is doing in this part of the world</p>\n<p>Our plans this year are to see at least twelve churches started here in Eastern Europe.<strong> We have the finances for ELEVEN of them already at $4,000 each.</strong> This is so wonderful as churches have already been started in Albania, Poland, Bulgaria and Slovakia.</p>\n<p><strong>Loving our Lives as Missionaries in Hungary,</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Jim and Brenda</strong></em></p>\n",

We are thinking back 21 years ago when we moved to here with our four children.  Back in 1997 when we came here we thought we would be here maybe one to three years.  “Man makes his Plans but God guides our steps..”  Proverbs.</p>\n<p>Since that time we have seen over 250 churches started, all the way from Poland to the north to Bulgaria and Albania  to the south.</p>\n<p>And now we are here in Hungary with three of our four children now living in the USA. We got to see a lot of them this summer and our two grandchildren.  Its so nice to see our boys now have families and just watch them from the background of how they raise their kids. Im sure our parents did the same for us. Just watched and gave is wisdom when we asked.  We thank God all our children are serving the Lord and involved in churches.</p>\n<p>So as we finish the last days of Summer and enter Fall we continue to do what we feel God has called us to do over here in Hungary and Eastern Europe.</p>\n<p>As always, thank you for helping us do what we are doing. We are well aware that we couldn’t do anything without you standing with us.</p>\n<p>In Awe of His Faithfulness.</p>\n<p>Brenda and Jim</p>\n",

I got to hear amazing stories from a Bulgarian Pastor, whose name is Grozdan and his wife Slavica. <strong>We helped them start a church in 20 in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria.</strong></p>\n<p>They shared with me the impact their church is making on the neighborhood where the church is. <strong><u>One of the programs that they have is a special needs school for children with Autism</u></strong>. They shared how not only the children are seeing great results but how the parents are in awe that this church would provide this special school.</p>\n<p><strong><em>This is just one sample of stories that we hear on almost a weekly basis of how these churches are changing individuals lives. We are humbled that we get to be a a part of it.</em></strong></p>\n<p>This year we once again have the opportunity to help start <strong><u>TWO more churches in Bulgaria. </u></strong></p>\n<p>Even now I am in contact with these leaders there and they are ready to start these churches in the coming months.

We are now in our 20th year as serving here in Hungary. </strong></em> It seems like so long ago when we moved here back in 1997 with our four children, with our youngest daughter, Audrianna, just ten months’ old.  Now just our daughter, Alexandra (22) is here with us.</p>\n<p>When we moved here we really didn’t know anyone. We had a few acquaintances but didn’t really know anyone at all.  <em><strong>We thought we would be here for maybe one to three years.</strong></em></p>\n<p>As we look back on all these years and all the things that have happened we can only look on with amazement.  <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Seeing all the churches started, all the lives impacted, all the countries touched and all the trips we have made throughout the years in this part of the world.  WE ARE IN AWE . . .</strong></span></p>\n<p>We still love traveling to all these different countries over here. In the past couple of weeks I have been in Slovenia, Serbia, Czech Republic and Bulgaria.  This month I will be in Slovakia and Poland.  I drive to most of these countries and usually only fly to Albania, Macedonia and Bulgaria.</p>\n<p><em><strong>While I’m in each of these countries, I am working with a different language. </strong></em> Even after all these years I am still amazed to be working with leaders in 11 languages.  Just about everyone is used to going through interpreters so it’s very normal for them.  I too am used to ministering with interpreters.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Most of the people I work with speak some English so that helps immensely</strong></em>.  I know a few sentences in many of the languages and that helps too.  Rarely does anyone speak Hungarian in Eastern Europe except for Hungarians.  No big surprise in this, as it’s one of the hardest languages to learn.    There are several million people that speak Hungarian in the countries right around Hungary as most of these countries have territory that was formally a part of Hungary.</p>\n<p>So for the rest of the year we will continue what we have been doing for almost 20 years now. Reaching cities, towns, and countries by helping start churches.</p>\n<p><em><strong>We continue to invest $4000.00 in each of these new works to help get them started. </strong></em>We want to help start at least FIFTEEN churches again this year. We have the finances for ELEVEN of them already.  We are so, so thrilled and encouraged.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Loving our Lives as Missionaries in Hungary,</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong><br />\n</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Jim and Brenda</strong></em></p>\n",

They talked about young people, about families and singles who are now attending the church.</p>\n<p>Then talked about this church wanting to start another church in a town close to them.  How a group of people come every week, from another town to this the new church but they want a church of their own in their own town.</p>\n<p><em><strong>This is a story we have heard over and over throughout the fifteen years now that we have helped these key leaders start churches over here.</strong></em></p>\n<p>It’s exciting for us to see these new churches reaching out, without our help, to reach their countries.</p>\n<p>So often missionaries build their ministries around themselves and their gifts and finances.

They had never been to something like this before. </strong></em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"> There were people walking in and out of the building, kids playing and talking, young people in the back of the building laughing and smoking cigarettes.

At the end of the service so many came forward to receive Christ.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"> So we are excited to see another Gypsy Church starting in Bulgaria this Spring.<em><strong> We are seeing so many lives changed, so many families impacted, so many people with new hope.

So most people even today would call themselves Muslim. In fact statistics say about 75% of the population claim to be Muslim. But few go to a mosque or follow this religion.</p>\n<p>We began to help start churches in Albania in 2001 in the capital city of Tirana. Tirana at that time was a city of more than a million people with less than 20 Christian churches in it.</p>\n<p>Since that time in 2001 when we helped to start that first church in Albania we have seen nine more churches started in there.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cmiworld.bezalelstudio.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fushekati-Hervin-Sedika-edit.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-815\" title=\"Fushekati, Hervin &amp; Sedika edit\" src=\"http://www.cmiworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fushekati-Hervin-Sedika-edit-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>That first church was started by a young couple who had come to Christ in the 1990&#8217;s.  Hervin was a Muslim that gave his life to Christ in 1993. He ended up going to Bible School in Germany then returned to Albania in 2001 to start a church. We were so thrilled to help him start this church.  Hervin and Sedika (his wife) have since become great friends and we have been to visit them many times. Even this year we are looking to help Hervin start another church in an area of Tirana that has no church in it.</p>\n<p>Hervin is just one of more than twenty key leaders that we work with throughout the countries of Eastern Europe from Poland to the far north to Bulgaria,  and Albania in the south.</p>\n<p>Since 1999 we have seen over 230 churches started here.  You have helped to make this happen. Even this year we will see at least another fifteen churches started.  Many of these have already started this year.</p>\n<p>We continue to invest $4,000 in each of these new churches.  We never ceased to be amazed by the impact these churches are making upon their towns and cities.</p>\n<p>Serving Him in Budapest,</p>\n<p>Jim and Brenda</p>\n",

We are always thrilled to talk about this.  If you have been receiving our letters for any length of time now, we hope you can tell how much we love doing what we do and how much we love living in Budapest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Our daily lives as missionaries would probably surprise some people.<em><strong> If you spent a few days with us here in Budapest you would see that in many ways our lives are just like yours.</strong></em></span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: small;\"><em><strong> We take our kids to school . . . We call the electrician for a problem in our house . . . We go grocery shopping . . . We take Audrianna, our 17 year old daughter to the dentist . .</strong></em> . And the list could go on and on.  So you can see that maybe our lives are not too out of the ordinary from a typical American family.\t\t\t\tBut at the same time so many, many things are different. The electrician who came to our house spoke no English.  The dentist has no receptionist and she and her assistant are the only ones in her modern dentist office, yet she is an excellent dentist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> The school Audrianna goes to has students of more than 20 nationalities but the classes are taught in English, plus she is in her third year of Spanish, but there are very few Spanish speakers in Hungary. \t\t\t\t\tThings we take for granted in America like paying bills online or with checks are different here. Hungary has no check system so all bills are paid in person at the post office. No bills are ever paid through the mail.  So several times a month we go to the Post Office and pay our bills in CASH. Bills such as internet, telephone, electric, trash pick up, etc.  It’s time consuming but you get used to it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Sometimes people want us to be more candid, maybe more transparent.  They want to know what is hard for us.  Here are just some of the challenges that we face on a personal basis as missionaries.  We miss our boys and our daughters in law who live in Orlando. . . <em><strong>This will be even harder when we have grand-kids. </strong></em> We miss our parents who live in Colorado and Florida, but we are thankful that we get to talk to them often by phone or email.  We miss American Culture so much.  We miss the restaurants (Mexican and BBQ).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><em><strong> We miss going to our Home Church and miss all the friends we have made throughout all these years in America.</strong></em> This is what is hardest for us.  But we don’t ever want to sound like we are complaining or want anyone to feel sorry for us. We love what we do and wouldn’t trade our lives for anything as we know this is what God has called us to do.  But at the same time we do really miss some things. </span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Thank you so much for standing with us in all we do here in Eastern Europe. Please know it is never taken for granted. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Thankful to be Serving Him, </span></strong></em><br />\n<em><strong><span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Jim and Brenda</span></strong></em><br />\n<strong><span style=\"font-size: small;\">PS.

    "content": "<h2>Special News From The Nations of Eastern Europe</h2>\n<p>August 1, 2013</p>\n<p><strong>Dear </strong><strong>Special Friends, </strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Whenever  we are back in America and speak at churches, people ask us all the  time to not only talk about the ministry we are involved in, but also  about our personal lives as missionaries.  They want to know what we do  on a daily basis and how we live.</strong></em></p>\n<p>In this months special letter to you we want to do something just a  little different.  This is a  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS letter.  Often  we are asked these questions or questions similar to them regarding  living and serving here as missionaries in Budapest, Hungary.</p>\n<p><strong>1.  How much longer do you see yourselves living in Budapest? </strong>When we  first came to Budapest back in 1997, we thought we would live here  probably about one to three years. Now its fifteen years later and we  still have no plans of leaving here anytime soon.</p>\n<p><strong>2.  What are some of the biggest differences of living in Hungary  compared to America? </strong>Everything over here seems to take longer.  From  grocery shopping to paying bills to even getting a plumber to come to  the house.  Whenever we are back in America, we are always amazed how  easy it is to do daily things.</p>\n<p><strong> 3.  Do you miss living in America? </strong> Sometimes we do.  But we know this  is where God has us.  Most of the time we love living here and consider  it special that we get to serve here.</p>\n<p><strong> 4.  How do your children like living in Budapest? </strong> Our youngest  daughter, Audrianna,  said something not too long ago that showed us how  she likes it. She said &#8220;she felt so blessed that she is from America  and gets to go there sometimes but also gets to live in Hungary.&#8221;  There  have been times they would like to live in America, but for the most  part they love living here.</p>\n<p><strong> 5.   You sound like you really like being missionaries, is this really  true? </strong> It is really true.  There have been times over the years where we  thought of doing something else but deep down we knew this is what we  are called to do.  We absolutely love serving the Lord in this part of  the world.</p>\n<p><strong> 6.  What is the food like in Hungary and Eastern Europe? </strong> We generally  like the food here, but we still would much rather have American food.   We like the Hungarian Goulash, especially in the winter as it’s nice to  have something hot when its freezing outside.  They eat a lot of  sausage’s, potatoes, Hungarian purple cabbage, chicken paprika, and pork  here.  Some of it is very strange to us.</p>\n<p><strong> 7.  You work in so many countries in Eastern Europe, do you speak the  languages or does everyone know English?</strong> We speak quite good Spanish,  Ok Russian and OK Hungarian, but there are ELEVEN different languages in  the countries we work in.  Polish in Poland, Slovak in Slovakia,  Albanian in Albania, Romanian in Romania, etc., etc., etc.  Most of the  key leaders we work with speak some English so we are able to talk to  them, but when we minister in the churches, we always have interpreters.  This works very well and the people are quite used to this.</p>\n<p><strong>8.  What do you miss the most or what is the hardest about living in  Hungary? </strong> For me, Jim, I miss the conveniences of America.  It seems so  easy to do everything in America. From paying the bills, to shopping, to  even having to return something to a store here. Everything takes  longer and seems a lot more complicated.  Everything about America is  service.  Most places over here its not that way.</p>\n<p><strong>9.  What do you do for fun? </strong>We like to go to restaurants. We have some  favorites.  They have ONE MEXICAN restaurant here.  We enjoy going  there, in fact we went there a couple of weeks ago on Easter Sunday.  We also like to travel.  It’s so nice because in Europe most things are pretty close so we<br />\nare able to travel to places like Vienna, Rome, Venice, and Paris.    They do have multiplex theaters here where they show the latest movies  from America.  Most are already dubbed into Hungarian.  But some are in  English with Hungarian Subtitles.</p>\n<p><strong>10.  What about things like FACEBOOK? Is it big in Hungary? </strong>Yes  FACEBOOK is very big over here.  I have “friends” that post messages in,  Romanian, Serbian, Polish, Hungarian, Albanian and Bulgarian on my  “wall.”  Sometimes I can use “goggle translate” to translate them.</p>\n<p><strong>11. Is it safe there in Hungary? Is there a lot of crime? </strong> It’s very  safe here.  Violent crime is very rare.  Budapest for example is about  two and a half million people and the buses, trams and subways are very  safe, even at night.  They do have petty crime though, pickpockets,  stealing purses and such.   We travel to other countries all the time.   In fact you see people even “hitchhiking” here. Both young people and  old people.  Rarely do we ever hear of problems.</p>\n<p>If you ever have any questions about anything regarding us personally  or our ministry don’t ever hesitate to email us. We are always happy to  share our lives with people.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cmiworld.bezalelstudio.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Jim-and-Brenda-Puhr-in-Budapest.tiff\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-624\" title=\"Jim and Brenda Puhr in Budapest\" src=\"http://cmiworld.bezalelstudio.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Jim-and-Brenda-Puhr-in-Budapest.tiff\" alt=\"\" /></a><br />\n<em><strong>In Awe of God’s Faithfulness,</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong> Jim and Brenda</strong></em></p>\n<p>PS.  Please enjoy the enclosed profiles about us.  From them you may get to know us better.</p>\n",

I remember how excited he was to start it in an area that had no churches in it and the impact the new church would make on the community.</p>\n<p><strong>I told Erion that when he had firm plans on when he would start the church to let me know.  Last fall Erion contacted me and we were able to sow $4000.00 into helping to start the church.</strong></p>\n<p>Earlier this year I was able to minister at his church and meet a lot of the people that are now a part of the church. It was wonderful to see the excitement of everyone.  <em><strong>I was quite humbled when I got up to speak and everyone clapped and stood to thank us for helping them.</strong></em></p>\n<p>What really impressed me was the hunger for the things of God.  I prayed for many of the people and saw tears in so many eyes.  <em><strong>It is so humbling to know we were a part of seeing this church get started.</strong></em></p>\n<p>It also amazed me that so many people came up and thanked us for thinking of them.  I was able to share with them that people in America had given the money to help start the church.  <em><strong>They were so inspired that people who did not know them, cared so much about them to give to help them.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Erion is also very involved in prison ministry in Albania, where he goes weekly to prisons throughout the country.  When he told me this I remembered the scripture about Jesus saying, <span style=\"font-family: WP TypographicSymbols,Helvetica Neue Light;\">&#8220;</span>When I was in prison you visited me.<span style=\"font-family: WP TypographicSymbols,Helvetica Neue Light;\">&#8220;</span> Maybe in one of our newsletters in the future I will share about the prisons in Albania and the conditions there.  <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>They are quite </strong></span><span style=\"font-family: WP TypographicSymbols,Helvetica Neue Light;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong> </strong></span></span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>rough.</strong></span><span style=\"font-family: WP TypographicSymbols,Helvetica Neue Light;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong> </strong></span></span></p>\n<p>Erion<span style=\"font-family: WP TypographicSymbols,Helvetica Neue Light;\">&#8216;</span>s church is typical of the churches that we help to start in this part of the world.  When I think of the thousands of towns and villages that still do not have a single church, I think of people like Erion and the impact of ministries like ours working together to make a difference in people<span style=\"font-family: WP TypographicSymbols,Helvetica Neue Light;\">&#8216;</span>s lives.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Last year this church in Albania was just one of FIFTEEN that we saw started. This year another FIFTEEN will be started.  Thank you for helping us do this.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Special Family News . . . </strong> We are in America now and will be here for another three weeks and then head home to Budapest.  <em><strong>Its been a wonderful summer for all of us! Getting together with our kids and doing so much fun stuff together has been so nice. </strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>In Awe of His Faithfulness,</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Jim and Brenda</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PS.

their own language, culture and are generally outcasts in their own  country.</p>\n<p>For the last ten years we have been able to help start  about 15 churches targeting just Gypsy communities in many of the  countries here in Eastern Europe.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s always wonderful to be  able to minister in these churches as they are full of life and the  people are so hungry for the things of God.  A few weeks ago I  ministered at a Gypsy church in Bulgaria and was amazed at the young  girls dancing before the Lord, singing beautiful worship songs.</p>\n<p>Even  now we are working with some key Romanian leaders to start several more  churches in villages where mainly Gypsies live that have no church.   This is always exciting to see the impact these new churches make.</p>\n<p><a

alt=\"\" /><strong><em>&#8220;The Power of Perseverance in Faith&#8221; is a title of a message I give often</em></strong>. I have given this message all over Eastern Europe, in churches large and small.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s one of my favorite messages to give as we have lived it all areas of our lives and ministry.  It essentially speaks about trusting in God through all circumstances and challenges.  Through family issues, health and financial issues and all the ministry challenges we have faced throughout the years.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Our society, whether in America or here in Eastern Europe is so fast paced it seems. Whether it&#8217;s going through the McDonald&#8217;s drive Thru (yes they have them here), or believing to get out of debt or looking for more ministry results</em>.  <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">We want everything faster and faster.</span></strong> So much of this has transferred itself in to the church also. We want it right away or if we don&#8217;t see it right away we wonder if it is &#8220;God&#8217;s Will?</p>\n<p>Whether I minister in a village in Slovakia, or a large church in Sofia, Bulgaria, people are facing the same issues and challenges.  It&#8217;s wonderful to see the faith of the people build as the Word goes forth. Whenever we minister we always try to make a connection with the people by telling<strong> &#8220;our own real life stories&#8221; </strong>of challenges we have faced whether it&#8217;s in our own family or with finances or health issues.  I always want them to see that we face some of the same challenges even as missionaries. It&#8217;s part of life.</p>\n<p><strong><em>We are now in our 29th year as serving as missionaries.  We are always amazed at God&#8217;s timing and how faithful HE is in every situation. </em></strong>So many, many times we have seen tremendous answers to prayer in so many ways that have come after years of standing and persevering in faith.</p>\n<p>When we first felt the Lord leading us to begin helping national leaders here in Eastern Europe we faced some tremendous financial challenges right away. Everything seemed to go wrong. But we knew what we felt God had put in our hearts.  We could have quit right away and questioned whether we were on the right track.  <strong><em>We stayed faithful and for the last 10 years we have seen over 160 churches started in this part of the world.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Perseverance.</span><em> We don&#8217;t always like it. We want it right away.  But perseverance brings great fruit. </em></strong>So many of our partners have stood with us for many, many years. Thank You!</p>\n<p><strong><em>SPECIAL FAMILY NEWS . . .</em> We are so excited that our son Nathan is getting married today, on May 1. </strong> Nathan met a wonderful girl last year at his church in Orlando. Lori came to Budapest for Christmas and we love her.  So we are here in Orlando for a week for the wedding.  We are so happy for them. <strong><em> </em></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em> In Awe of God</em></strong><strong><em>s Faithfulness,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em><br />\n</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em> Jim and Brenda</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em><br />\n</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>PS.  We are so excited about the rest of the year here in Eastern Europe.

Their parents are from one country, they grow up in another country.</p>\n<p><strong> * </strong> They continually have to leave friends.</p>\n<p><strong> * </strong> They have to learn new cultures.</p>\n<p><strong> * </strong> They change schools.</p>\n<p><strong> *</strong> They have to learn new languages.</p>\n<p><strong> * </strong> They sometimes feel they miss out on things in America.</p>\n<p><strong> *</strong> <strong>They miss going to Taco Bell, Subway, Chili&#8217;s, Starbucks , Olive Garden<em> </em>and Walmart.<em> </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong> * <em> The list could go on and on . . .</em><em> </em></strong></p>\n<p>But probably the most challenging for all our children has been and still is for our girls, is having to leave close friends or seeing close friends move away. This was especially true for our boys, Nathan and Ryan.  <strong><em>They said say goodbyes  to friends in Costa Rica, Florida, and Russia, when we left those countries. </em></strong>It was hard for them. It got old.  They let us know they didn&#8217;t like it<strong><em>.  <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">It was a challenge for us, it was much more of a challenge for them!</span></em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></em></strong></p>\n<p>By the grace of God, our children never had bitterness or gave us &#8220;too hard of a time&#8221; when we moved.  We knew they were going through things, therefore we <strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">prayed, asked for God&#8217;s Grace, and gave extra attention to our children.</span></em></strong></p>\n<p>Now if you ask our boys about growing up on the mission field they will have nothing but positive things to say.  Our girls love growing up as &#8220;missionary kids.&#8221;  Not all missionary families have this same experience with their kids.  Each child is so different and sees things differently.  Sometimes we don&#8217;t even know what we did right. <strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">We do know that there are many, many people praying for us.</span></em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></em></strong></p>\n<p>Our kids have had the opportunity to travel and see other parts of the world, meet people from other cultures, they have been with us as we ministered and they have also had opportunities to minister.  <strong><em>They have been blessed to have many wonderful experiences as &#8220;missionary kids.&#8221;  We don&#8217;t think they would trade them for anything!</em></strong></p>\n<p>Now Nathan and Ryan, who live in Orlando, love to talk to their friends about growing up around the world.   Every year they love to come back to Budapest for Christmas.  Audrianna and Alexandra are still with us here in Budapest and love living and going to school here.  <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Thank you for standing with us not only with the ministry but also with our family.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><br />\n</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em> In Awe of His Faithfulness,</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em><br />\n</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em> Jim and Brenda</em></strong></p>\n",

    "content": "<h2>Special News From The Nations of Eastern Europe</h2>\n<p>April 1, 2011</p>\n<p>Dear Special Friends Around the World</p>\n<p>SPECIAL FAMILY NEWS . . . We are so excited that our son Nathan is getting married on May 1. Nathan met a wonderful girl last year at his church in Orlando. Lori came to Budapest for Christmas and we love her. So we will be making a quick trip back to America for the wedding in Orlando.</p>\n<p>Ministry Update . . . As you look at the nations listed on the right of this page, I want you to know that they each represent nations where we minister. In almost all of these countries we have worked with key leaders to help start churches.</p>\n<p>I think of Albania where I have been five times in the last few months. This past weekend I was able to minister in two of the churches that we have helped to start and saw firsthand the amazing lives of the people in them.</p>\n<p>It is so humbling to see the families, the children and the singles and the teenagers everywhere. Both churches in are reaching their communities.</p>\n<p>Few people may have ever heard of Albania, this nation of 3.2 million people, yet we love to go to the places that few have heard of.</p>\n<p>Albania is so interesting as it is about 76% Muslim, yet we are able to make an impact on this nation, having started several churches there.

This is a FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS letter. Often we are asked these questions or questions similar to them regarding living and serving here as missionaries in Budapest, Hungary.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>How much longer do you see yourselves living in Budapest?</strong> When we first came to Budapest back in 1997, we thought we would live here probably about one to three years. Now its thirteen years later and we still have no plans of leaving here anytime soon.</li>\n<li><strong>What are some of the biggest differences of living in Hungary compared to America?</strong> Everything over here seems to take longer. From grocery shopping to paying bills to even getting a plumber to come to the house. Whenever we are back in America, we are always amazed how easy it is to do daily things.</li>\n<li><strong>Do you miss living in America?</strong> Sometimes we do. But we know this is where God has us. Most of the time we love living here and consider it special that we get to serve here.</li>\n<li><strong>How do your children like living in Budapest?</strong> Our youngest daughter, Audrianna, said something not too long ago that showed us how she likes it. She said &#8220;she felt so blessed that she is from America and gets to go there sometimes but also gets to live in Hungary.&#8221; There have been times they would like to live in America, but for the most part they love living here.</li>\n<li><strong>You sound like you really like being missionaries, is this really true?</strong> It is really true. There have been times over the years where we thought of doing something else but deep down we knew this is what we are called to do. We absolutely love serving the Lord in this part of the world.</li>\n<li><strong>How do you get the pastors for the new churches that you help to start in Eastern Europe?</strong> We work with key national leaders in all the countries over here. The new pastors come out of some of these key churches. The new churches and new pastors are then overseen by this key national pastor.</li>\n<li><strong>You work in so many countries in Eastern Europe, do you speak the languages or does everyone know English?</strong> We speak quite good Spanish, Ok Russian and OK Hungarian, but there are ELEVEN different languages in the countries we work in. Polish in Poland, Slovak in Slovakia, Albanian in Albania, Romanian in Romania, etc, etc, etc. Most of the key leaders we work with speak some English so we are able to talk to them. But when we minister in the churches, we always have interpreters. This works very well and the people are quite used to this.</li>\n<li><strong>You say you need $4,000.00 to help start a new church in Eastern Europe. </strong>What is this money used for? We know that $4,000 won&#8217;t make a church become successful. We see this as seed money to help get it off the ground. Usually this money will last from nine to eighteen months. It is usually used to rent a building on Sunday morning, help pay for outreaches the first year, and partial payment for the pastors&#8217; salary. In small towns and villages this money will go a long way as things tend to be very inexpensive in these towns.</li>\n<li><strong>How are you able to see FIFTEEN new churches started in one year?</strong> The way that we can do this is by our key relationships with national pastors in all of Eastern Europe. By working along side them and their vision we are able to accelerate what they are doing. They are the ones that are actually starting the churches and we work along side them. These churches are not dependant on our being there week after week. They have to make it happen, but we are there to encourage, counsel, and minister with them as the church gets off the ground.</li>\n</ol>\n",

We are so excited that our son Nathan is getting married on May 1. Nathan met a wonderful girl last year at his church in Orlando. Lori came to Budapest for Christmas and we love her. So we will be making a quick trip back to America for the wedding in Orlando.</p>\n<p>Ministry Update . . . As you look at the nations listed on the right of this page, I want you to know that they each represent nations where we minister. In almost all of these countries we have worked with key leaders to help start churches.</p>\n<p>I think of Albania where I have been five times in the last few months. This past weekend I was able to minister in two of the churches that we have helped to start and saw firsthand the amazing lives of the people in them.</p>\n<p>It is so humbling to see the families, the children and the singles and the teenagers everywhere. Both churches in are reaching their communities.</p>\n<p>Few people may have ever heard of Albania, this nation of 3.2 million people, yet we love to go to the places that few have heard of.</p>\n<p>Albania is so interesting as it is about 76% Muslim, yet we are able to make an impact on this nation, having started several churches there. Even in the next few months we will see TWO more churches started in Albanian towns.</p>\n<p>If you were with me this past weekend, you would have seen these churches in buildings with signs in front written Albanian saying &#8220;Kisha Shqiptare I Kristere&#8221;, which means &#8220;Albanian Christian Church.&#8221; On Sunday morning it was wonderful to see the people coming into the church.
